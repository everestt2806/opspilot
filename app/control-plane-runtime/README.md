# Product controller runtime (Linux)

This runtime is a separate Node 22 artifact. It imports the Product SQLite repository and the existing migrations, but does not bootstrap Electron, the renderer, safeStorage, monitor, ML, or a deployment executor.

## Build and initialize

From `app/control-plane-runtime`, install the isolated dependencies and build the bundle:

```sh
npm ci
node ../scripts/build-control-plane.mjs
node dist/control-plane.cjs init --data-dir /var/lib/opspilot-controller
node dist/control-plane.cjs status --data-dir /var/lib/opspilot-controller
```

`init` is explicit and refuses to replace an existing database. It creates one controller identity only; it does not enroll applications, write Product ownership/source configuration, or infer Desktop-mode state. The data directory must be private to the service user (`0700`) and the database file is restricted to `0600`. `run`, `poll-once`, and `status` require that initialized identity and fail closed for missing, insecure, or invalid data.

`run --data-dir ...` serves only `GET /healthz` on `127.0.0.1:8768`, then polls configured Product-owned GitHub branches. It does not expose the `/v1` API. `poll-once` performs one poll without opening an HTTP listener. Both paths only observe Git and reconcile durable desired state/job records; neither claims nor executes a job.

The systemd example is `opspilot-controller.service.example`. It is a template only and is not installed by the build or CLI.
